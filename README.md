# B Plus Tree Implementation in PHP

B+ Tree implemented in PHP for the web environment. This project was started while I was learning to code for the web environment. B+ Trees were mentioned in my Database Design & Implementation class and decided to try to code it. This is nowhere near done and I would like to make some changes as I get the time.

Current:
  > Bulk-adds elements to the tree and then prints it out to the browser.
  > Can insert and properly split leaf or parent nodes as needed.
  > Shows the page 
  
Future:
  > Be able to insert as needed rather than just add at page load
  > Draw the tree between insertions to showcase what's happening to the tree
